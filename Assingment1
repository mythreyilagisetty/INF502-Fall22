4. Write a command sequence to merge the non-master branch into master.

```
git checkout master
git merge math

```

5. Write a command (or sequence) to (i) create a new branch called math (from the master) and (ii) change to this branch.

```
git checkout master
git branch math (fatal: a branch named 'math' already exists)
git checkout math

6. Edit B.py adding the following source code below the content you have there.
print 'I know math, look:'
print 2+2

```
ml3239@CMP5006 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Handson (master|MERGING)
$ git add B.py

ml3239@CMP5006 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Handson (master|MERGING)
$ git status
On branch master
All conflicts fixed but you are still merging.
  (use "git commit" to conclude merge)

Changes to be committed:
        modified:   A.py
        modified:   B.py


ml3239@CMP5006 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Handson (master|MERGING)
$ git commit -m "B.py"

    git commit --amend --reset-author


ml3239@CMP5006 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Handson (master)
$ git commit -m "B.py"
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

```


7. Write a command (or sequence) to commit your changes.

```
git add B.py
git commit -m "addition of two lines to B.py on math branch"

```


8. Change back to the master branch and change B.py adding the following source code (commit your change to master):
print 'hello world!'

```
git checkout master
git add B.py
git commit -m "adding one line to B.py on master branch"
```

9. Write a command sequence to merge the math branch into master and describe what happened.

```
ml3239@CMP5006 MINGW64 ~/Desktop/Handson (master)
$ git merge math
Already up to date.


git checkout master
git merge math

```


10. Write a set of commands to abort the merge.

```

git merge --abort

```


11. Now repeat item 9, but proceed with the manual merge (editing B.py). All implemented methods are needed. Explain your procedure.

```

no errors are seen. None of the files are copied

```

12. Write a command (or set of commands) to proceed with the merge and make master branch up-to-date.

```

git checkout master
git merge math
git rebase

```


13. Complete Part 2. Then, come back here and answer the following: Report your experience of submitting the Part 2. Please, include the steps you followed, the commands you used, and the hurdles you faced (within the file you created for the Part 1).

```
I faced a lot of trouble on creating the .md file and creting the pull request.
